# Changeset Guidelines

## When to Create a Changeset

After completing a feature, fix, or significant change, **always create a changeset file** in `.changeset/`.

### Triggers for Changesets

Create a changeset when:
- ✅ New feature implemented
- ✅ Bug fix completed
- ✅ Breaking change introduced
- ✅ Performance improvement made
- ✅ New workflow or CI/CD change
- ✅ Dependency update with user impact

### Skip Changesets for

- ❌ Documentation-only changes
- ❌ Code style/formatting changes
- ❌ Test-only changes
- ❌ Internal refactoring without user impact

## Changeset Format

Create a file in `.changeset/` with a random name like `happy-dogs-dance.md`:

```md
---
"MiniFy": <type>
---

<Short description of the change>

- Detail 1
- Detail 2
```

**Line Length Limit: Maximum 99 characters per line.** Break longer descriptions into multiple lines.

### Version Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `major` | Breaking changes | Removed deprecated API |
| `minor` | New features | Added dark mode |
| `patch` | Bug fixes, improvements | Fixed login issue |

## Examples

### Feature (minor)

```md
---
"MiniFy": minor
---

- Users can now create custom themes
- Added theme import/export functionality
```

### Bug Fix (patch)

```md
---
"MiniFy": patch
---

```

### Breaking Change (major)

```md
---
"MiniFy": major
---

Migrated to new configuration format

- Old config files need to be migrated
- See migration guide in docs
```

## File Naming

Use kebab-case with random memorable words:
- `happy-dogs-dance.md`
- `brave-lions-jump.md`
- `quick-cats-sleep.md`

## Workflow Integration

Changesets are automatically processed during releases:
1. Changelog is generated from all changeset files
2. Version is bumped based on changeset types
3. Changeset files are deleted after release
